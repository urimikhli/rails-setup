Description:
    Create a database credentials yml file that holds the path to the username and password files.
    Create an initializer that adds the credentials to ActiveRecord.
Example:
    rails generate db_credentials database_name

    This will create:
      If they dont exist:
        config/initializers/database_credentials.rb
        config/database_credentials.yml

    Otherwise for: 
      config/database_credentials.yml
        It will insert the entry for the named database, if one doesnt already exist.
