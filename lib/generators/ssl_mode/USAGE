Description:

    rails generate ssl_setup

    This will:
        * insert the config.force_ssl = true line into applicaton.rb
        * insert code for starting rails development in SSL mode into bin/rails.
        * create a certs/ directory that holds the self signed certs needed to run in ssl mode. You will need to create your own self signed certifications. Google "self signed certificate in rails".
